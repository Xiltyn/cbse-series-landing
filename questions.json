    "answer":"(b) The movement of blood twice through the heart is known as double circulation. Double circulation is necessary in human beings as it allows separation of oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood for a more efficient supply of oxygen to the body cells. This efficient system of oxygen supply is very useful in warm-blooded animals such as human beings. As we know, warm-blooded animals have to maintain a constant body temperature (by cooling themselves when they are in a hotter environment and by warming their bodies when they are in a cooler environment). Hence, they require more O2 for more respiration, so that they can produce more energy to maintain their body temperature.

    "answer":"The scattering of light is the phenomenon by which a beam of light is redirected in different directions on interacting with the particles present in the medium. The scattered light's colour depends on the size of the scattering particles. The particles of very small size scatter mainly blue light whereas, the particles of larger size scatter lights of longer wavelengths. The sky appears blue because the fine particles in the atmosphere scatter blue light the most among all the components of white light. At sunrise, the Sun is located near the horizon. Hence, the light has to travel a long distance through the Earth’s atmosphere. At the time of sunrise or sunset, when white sunlight falls on suspended atmospheric particles, the blue colour light scatters out in the atmosphere, while the red colour light scatters less and reaches the eyes of the observer on the surface of the Earth. Hence, when this less scattered red light reaches eyes of the observer, the Sun and its surroundings appear reddish."

    "answer":"Soap molecules are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic acids whereas detergent molecules are ammonium or sulphonate salts of long-chain carboxylic acids. Cleansing action of soaps: The dirt present on clothes is organic in nature and is insoluble in water. Therefore, it cannot be removed by only washing with water. When soap is dissolved in water, its hydrophobic ends attach themselves to the dirt and remove it from the cloth. Then, the molecules of soap arrange themselves in micelle formation and trap the dirt at the centre of the cluster. These micelles remain suspended in the water and, thus, the dust particles are easily rinsed away by water. Soaps do not form lather in hard water because soap molecules react with calcium and magnesium ions present in hard water to form insoluble substance, called scuum which remains after washing in water.

Apply the right hand rule to find out the direction of the magnetic field inside and outside the loop.",
    "answer":"A solenoid is a coil of insulated or enameled wire wound on a rod-shaped form made of solid iron, solid steel, or powdered iron. Devices of this kind can be used as electromagnets, as inductors in electronic circuits, and as miniature wireless receiving antennas. In a solenoid, the core material is ferromagnetic, meaning that it concentrates magnetic lines of flux. This increases the inductance of the coil far beyond the inductance obtainable with an air-core coil of the same dimensions and the same number of turns. When current flows in the coil, most of the resulting magnetic flux exists within the core material. Some flux appears outside the coil near the ends of the core; a small amount of flux also appears outside the coil and off to the side. A solenoid chime is wound on a cylindrical, hollow, plastic or phenolic form with a movable, solid iron or steel core. The core can travel in and out of the coil along its axis.

    "answer":"Natural rubber is one of nature's unique materials. The Native Americans of tropical South America's Amazon basin knew of rubber and its uses long before Christopher Columbus's explorations brought it to the attention of Europeans. The Indians made balls of rubber by smoking the milky, white latex of trees of the genus Hevea that had been placed on a wooden paddle, to promote water evaporation and to cure the substance. Spanish navigator and historian Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdes (1478–1557) was the first European to describe these balls to a European audience. In 1615 a Spanish writer enumerated the practical uses of rubber. He reported that the Indians waterproofed their cloaks by brushing them with this latex and made waterproof shoes by coating earthen molds with it and allowing these coatings to dry. In 1735 interest was revived in this unusual substance when French mathematical geographer and explorer Charles-Marie de La Condamine (1701–1774) sent several rolls of crude rubber to France w"

    "answer":"Atomic number of carbon is six. This means that it has four electrons in its outermost shell and it needs four more electrons to attain noble gas electronic configuration. It does not form C4+ cation, as the removal of four valence electrons will require a huge amount of energy. The cation formed will have six protons and two electrons. This makes it highly unstable. Carbon is unable to form C4− anion as its nucleus with six protons will not be able to hold ten electrons. Thus, carbon achieves noble gas electronic configuration by sharing its four electrons with other elements, i.e. it forms covalent compounds. (i) Covalent compounds are bad conductors of electricity due to lack of free electrons. (ii) Covalent compounds are formed by covalent bonds and it has been found that the intermolecular forces of attraction in covalent compounds are weak.

Since it often produced from materials that form sewage and waste products, the only time it will be depleted is when we stop producing any waste.2. Non-Polluting: It is also considered to be non-polluting in nature. The production of biogas does not require oxygen, which means that resources are conserved by not using any further fuel.3. Reduces Landfills: It also uses up waste material found in landfills, dump sites and even farms across the country, allowing for decreased soil and water pollution.4. Cheaper Technology: Applications for biogas are increasing as the technology to utilize it gets better. It can be used to produce electricity and for the purpose of heating as well.

During this process, a large amount of heat is also evolved, which increases the temperature of the system. This confirms that a chemical reaction has taken place. Also, when calcium carbonate is heated, it decomposes to form calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. In this reaction, calcium carbonate breaks down to form calcium oxide and carbon dioxide.

    "answer":"(a) Mendel demonstrated that traits can be either dominant or recessive through his monohybrid cross. He crossed true-breeding tall (TT) and dwarf (tt) pea plants. The seeds formed after fertilisation were grown and the plants that were formed represent the first filial or F1 generation. All the F1 plants obtained were tall. Then, Mendel self-pollinated the F1 plants and observed that all plants obtained in the F2 generation were not tall. Instead, one-fourth of the F2 plants were short. From this experiment, Mendel concluded that the F1 tall plants were not true breeding; they were carrying traits of both short height and tall height. They appeared tall only because the tall trait was dominant over the dwarf trait. This shows that traits may be dominant or recessive. (b) Mendel demonstrated that traits are inherited independently through his dihybrid cross. He considered two traits at a time, seed colour and seed shape in which yellow colour (YY) and round shape (RR) are dominant over green"

    "answer":"(i) Oxygen enters the human body through the nasal passage and reaches the lungs. (ii) Numerous alveoli are present in the lungs. These alveoli are surrounded by many blood capillaries. From the alveoli, O2 is taken up by the red blood cells present in the blood capillaries. (iii) Similarly, the CO2 from the various tissues is transported to the alveoli. (iv) This CO2 is then released through the nasal passage during exhalation. Alveoli are the sites of exchange of gases. Each lung contains 300−350 million alveoli. These alveoli increase the surface area for gaseous exchange, making the process of respiration more efficient."

    "answer":"Scattering of light is more pronounced when the size of the scatterer is comparable to the wavelength of the light. At sunrise, the Sun is located near the horizon. Hence, the light has to travel a long distance through the Earth’s atmosphere. At the time of sunrise or sunset, when white sunlight falls on the suspended atmospheric particles, the blue colour light scatters out more in the atmosphere because the size of the atmospheric particles are comparable to the wavelength of the blue colour light, while the red colour light scatters less because it has larger wavelength than the blue colour light. So, the red colour light reaches the eyes of the observer on the surface of the Earth. Hence, when this less scattered red light reaches the eyes of the observer, the Sun and its surroundings appear reddish. At noon, the sun is nearly overhead and the light from the Sun travels a relatively shorter distance. Therefore, at noon, only a little of the blue and violet colour lights are scattered, making the"

A soap is a sodium or potassium salt of long chain fatty acids. Hard water contains salts of calcium and magnesium. When soap is added to hard water, calcium and magnesium ions present in water displace sodium or potassium ions from the soap molecules forming an insoluble substance called scuum. A lot of soap is wasted in the process. (b) Cleansing action of soaps: The oily spot present on clothes is organic in nature and insoluble in water. Therefore, it cannot be removed by only washing with water. When soap is dissolved in water, its hydrophobic ends attach themselves to the oily spot and remove it from the cloth.

Hence, the galvanometer present in the circuit shows momentary deflection. As the charge on the capacitor grows, the conduction current in the wires increases. When the capacitor is fully charged, the conduction current stops flowing in the wires. During charging or discharging of the capacitor, there is no conduction current between the plates of capacitor, as they are not connected by any conduction material.

    "answer":"As the light from the sun travels through the atmosphere, it gets scattered in different direction by the air molecules present in its path. The blue(or violet) light due to its short wavelength is scattered more as compared to the red light of long wavelength. Thus light reaching our eye directly from the sun is rich in red colour while the light reaching our eye from all other direction of sun is the scattered blue light.

    "answer":"(a) In unpolarised light, light waves vibrate in more than one plane; whereas in linearly polarised light, vibrations of light waves occur in a single plane. (b) A polaroid consists of long-chain molecules aligned in a particular direction. The electric vectors (associated with the propagating light wave) along the direction of the aligned molecules get absorbed. Thus, if an unpolarised light wave is incident on such a polaroid, then the light wave will get linearly polarised with the electric vector oscillating along a direction perpendicular to the aligned molecule. (c) Unpolarized light scattering from air molecules shakes their electrons perpendicular to the direction of the original ray.

(b) The smallest potential difference that can be measured by potentiometer is called sensitivity of potentiometer. It can be increased by (i) increasing the length of the wire (ii) decreasing the current in the wire using a rheostat (c) Potentiometer is preferred over voltmeter to measure emf of a cell because it measures true emf of the cell. It uses null method, so no current is drawn by the galvanometer from the cell in balanced condition of potentiometer. On the other hand, a voltmeter measures the voltage across the terminals of a cell when the cell is in closed circuit, that is, when current is flowing through the cell. This voltage is not equal to the emf of the cell. In fact, it is equal to the emf minus the potential drop across the internal resistance"

    "content":"Distinguish between an intrinsic semiconductor and p-type semiconductor. Give reason, why a p-type semiconductor crystal is electrically neutral, although nh >> ne?",
    "answer":"Intrinsic semi-conductor is a pure semi-conducting material. No impurity atoms are present in it or added to it. A p-type semi-conductor is an extrinsic semi-conductor obtained by doping the impurity of trivalent atoms such as Al, B, In, etc. to an intrinsic semi-conductor. The charge of additional charge carriers present in a p-type semi-conductor are just equal and opposite to that of the ionised cores in the lattice. These additional charge carriers are balanced out by the ionised cores. Hence, a p-type semi-conductor is electrically neutral."

    "answer":"Nuclear fission is the shifting of heavy nucleus into two lighter nuclei with the liberation of high amount of energy whereas nuclear fusion is the joining of two lighter nuclei to form one heavy nucleus with the liberation of high amount of energy. (2.014102 u + 3.016049 u) → (4.002603 u + 1.00867 u) Mass lost = (2.014102 u + 3.016049 u) − (4.002603 u + 1.00867 u) m = 0.018878 u 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c2 Therefore, m = 0.018878 u = 0.018878 × 931.5 MeV/c2 E = mc2 = 0.018878 × 931.5 E = 17.58 MeV Therefore, the amount of energy released is 17.58 MeV."

(b) If the earth did not have atmosphere, would its average surface temperature be higher or lower than what it is now? Explain. (c) An em wave exerts pressure on the surface on which it is incident. Justify.",
    "answer":"(a) Microwaves are suitable for radar systems used in aircraft navigation. The range of frequency for these waves is 109 Hz to 1012 Hz. (b) In the absence of atmosphere, there would be no greenhouse effect on the surface of the Earth. As a result, the temperature of the Earth would decrease rapidly, making it difficult for human survival. (c) An em wave carries a linear momentum with it. The linear momentum carried by a portion of wave having energy U is given by p=Uc. Thus, if the wave incident on a material surface is completely absorbed, it delivers energy U and momentum p=Uc to the surface. If the wave is totally reflected, the momentum delivered is p=2Uc because the momentum of the wave changes from p to -p. Therefore, it follows that an em waves incident on a surface exert a force and hence a pressure on the surface."

    "content":"(a) Give two reasons to explain why reflecting telescopes are preferred over refracting type. (b) Use mirror equation to show that convex mirror always produces a virtual image independent of the location of the object.",
    "answer":"(a) The reflecting telescopes are preferred over refracting type because of the following reasons: (i) There is no chromatic aberration in case of reflecting telescopes as the objective is a mirror. (ii) Spherical aberration is reduced in case of reflecting telescopes by using mirror objective in the form of a paraboloid. (b) For convex mirror, focal length is always positive, f = +ve An object is placed on the left side of the mirror. So, the object distance, u = −ve or u < 0. Using the mirror formula we have, 1f=1v+1u⇒1v=1f-1u Since f > 0 and u < 0, then from the above equations, we get that 1v>0⇒v<0 Hence, a virtual image is always formed at the back side of the mirror. Therefore, the image formed by the convex mirror is always virtual in nature, independent of the location of the object."
